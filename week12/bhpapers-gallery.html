            Her.
That evening felt odd, though pleasant. The middle of the work week. Summer. Amelia rode home and locked her bike to the railing outside her apartment. Her neighbor’s bike was locked there, too. She cut her knuckle on its peddle, unexpectedly. 
She felt a subsiding irritation and sucked on her knuckle as she proceeded up the stairs to her apartment on the second floor. Stepping out of her shoes, she went and took a shower. Today, she washed her hair. 


        </p>

        <p>
            That evening they were going for drinks, and it would invariably end in the backyard, a fire, a rough morning. 
            
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She dressed in jean shorts and a tank top, which was her typical fit for the summertime. She lounged and read.  
            She was eating dinner when her roommate returned home. They discussed their days. Pleasantries. Around 7 they biked to meet friends at the bar, Barr’s. A friend of a friend chuckled over the name. They nodded and smiled with him. They got fries and discussed work and people and the music.
            Amelia felt the wane of the day. Her bed called, and she sought the coolness and noise of a fan in the dark of summer nights. She biked home early. The sky was still that twilight blue, a star was just emerging.
            She felt a buzz in the air. Unlike cicadas and humidity. The lamps along the street flicked on, nearly in time with her journey. 
            She got home, locked her bike—brushed her knuckle and uttered a short expletive—and went to bed. 
            The fan was too loud.
